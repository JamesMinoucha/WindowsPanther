A autounattend.xml made to debloat, optimize and make better Windows 11 (and 10). It is privacy oriented.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows Panther is only compatible with physical installation (USB), converting it to an iso will result in errors. You need to put the `autounattend.xml` file and the `resources` folder inside the installation device.

## Functionalities
